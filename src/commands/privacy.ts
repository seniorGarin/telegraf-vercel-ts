Hey there! This bot is just a demo showing how to deploy Telegram bots on Vercel.  We collect a little bit of info from Telegram (like your user ID, username, and messages) so we can understand what you're asking. ðŸ¤“

We only use this data to process your commands and send you the right answers.  We promise not to share it with anyone else!  ðŸ¤«

Your privacy matters to us. We keep your data safe and sound. ðŸ”’`;
